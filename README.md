# react-app-note-keeper
ReactJS App for keeping notes

As part of Dr. Angela Yu Web Development 2021 Course, I coded this Note keeper app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript & React.JS.
I have expanded on the original app to include some of my own development ideas such as:
1. User can choose a colour of a note
2. Notes can be prioritised as either high, medium or low
3. Notes hold the date added

<b>Future Development Ideas</b>

- User can arrange notes by drag and drop (drag and drop api)
- Notes can have an 'alert time' or 'reminder me on date'
- Notes can be categorised
- Notes can be locked & password protected
- Deployment environment with Firebase (done)
